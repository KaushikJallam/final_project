driver passenger todos


To enable drivers to see the passenger's trips and provide quotations, you need to implement a mechanism for drivers to view available trips and submit their quotations. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you can follow:

Create a new model for quotations:

Create a new model called Quotation that will store information about quotations provided by drivers.
The Quotation model should have attributes like driver_id, passenger_id, trip_id, quotation_amount, etc., to link the quotation to the respective driver, passenger, and trip.
Implement a form for drivers to submit quotations:

Create a WTForms form to allow drivers to enter their quotation amount for a specific trip.
When a driver submits the form, you should create a new Quotation object and save it in the database.
Display available trips to drivers:

In the driver's dashboard, fetch available trips (trips without a quotation) from the database.
Display these available trips to the driver, along with a form to submit a quotation.
Display quotations to passengers:

In the passenger's dashboard, fetch quotations for the passenger's trips from the database.
Display these quotations to the passenger, showing which driver provided the quotation and the quotation amount.
Allow passengers to accept quotations:

Add a button or link for passengers to accept a quotation for their trip.
When a passenger accepts a quotation, you can update the database to mark the trip as booked or in progress.
Implement any additional features as needed:

Depending on your application requirements, you may need to implement additional features, such as handling multiple quotations for a single trip, displaying trip status (e.g., booked, in progress, completed), etc.
Remember to define the relationships between the Quotation, User, and Trip models in SQLAlchemy, and handle the data flow between the frontend (HTML templates) and backend (Flask routes) to make these features work.

It's important to ensure that only authenticated drivers can submit quotations and only authenticated passengers can view available trips and accept quotations. You can use the login_required decorator to protect the relevant routes and ensure that users are authenticated before accessing them.
